in 5712

the 22906

evidently 42

this 1925
day 145
to 5281
us 133
now 146
it 3057
seems 131
almost 65
inexplicable 2
that 2876
these 639
valuable 11

interesting 21
original 223
texts 42
should 299
have 934
remained 33
so 641
long 125
unpublished 3
and 8393
indeed 41
forgotten 3
it 3057
is 4252
certain 89
that 2876
during 31
the 22906
xvith 12
and 8393
xviith 3
centuries 9
their 737
exceptional 9
value 20
was 582
highly 30
appreciated 4
this 1925
is 4252
proved 89
not 1185
merely 41
by 2138
the 22906
prices 2
which 2527
they 835
commanded 2
but 800
also 202
by 2138
the 22906
exceptional 9
interest 31
which 2527
has 543
been 363
attached 16
to 5281
the 22906
change 28
of 11214
ownership 2
of 11214
merely 41
a 4724
few 69

notwithstanding 5
this 1925
eagerness 1
to 5281
possess 7
the 22906
manuscripts 47
their 737
contents 16
remained 33
a 4724
mystery 3
can 330
only 301
be 2099
accounted 3
for 1177
by 2138
the 22906
many 248

great 298
difficulties 9
attending 2
the 22906
task 10
of 11214
deciphering 4
them 615
the 22906

is 4252
so 641
peculiar 11
that 2876
it 3057

of 11214
an 538

peculiar 11
to 5281
himself 115

had 282
a 4724

several 77
short 54
words 66
into 402
one 736
long 125

are 1698
there 489
any 372

the 22906
reader 22
may 610
imagine 9
that 2876
such 295
difficulties 9
were 373
almost 65
sufficient 13
to 5281
make 297
the 22906
task 10
seem 111
a 4724
desperate 3
one 736
to 5281
a 4724
beginner 1
it 3057
is 4252
therefore 124
not 1185
surprising 4
that 2876
the 22906
good 132
intentions 2
of 11214
some 346
of 11214
leonardo 424
s 260
most 254
reverent 1
admirers 1
should 299

failed 3
leonardos 202
literary 13
labours 12

various 187
departments 2
both 87
of 11214

of 11214
science 27
were 373
those 389
essentially 3
of 11214
an 538
enquirer 1
hence 96
the 22906
analytical 1
method 41
is 4252
that 2876
which 2527
he 657
employs 3
in 5712
arguing 3
out 265
his 842
investigations 16
and 8393
dissertations 3
the 22906
vast 28
structure 20
of 11214
his 842
scientific 17
theories 4
is 4252
consequently 16
built 22
up 308
of 11214
numerous 38
separate 35
researches 19
and 8393
it 3057
is 4252
much 268
to 5281
be 2099
lamented 2
that 2876
he 657
should 299
never 149
have 934
collated 1

a 4724
page 94

the 22906
motion 98
of 11214

the 22906

philosophical 6

to 5281
the 22906
relations 13
of 11214
poetry 11
to 5281
painting 180
and 8393
so 641
forth 40
leonardo 424
himself 115
lamented 2
this 1925
confusion 20
and 8393
for 1177
that 2876
reason 126
i 956
do 257
not 1185
think 18
that 2876
the 22906
publication 20
of 11214
the 22906
texts 42
in 5712
the 22906
order 93
in 5712
which 2527
they 835
occur 34
in 5712
the 22906
originals 7
would 372
at 1573
all 681
fulfil 3
his 842
intentions 2
no 1050
reader 22
could 117
find 151
his 842
way 207
through 267
such 295
a 4724
labyrinth 2
leonardo 424
himself 115
could 117
not 1185
have 934
done 72
it 3057
added 47
to 5281
this 1925
more 471
than 652
half 135
of 11214
the 22906
five 31
thousand 24
manuscript 35
pages 20
which 2527
now 146
remain 69
to 5281
us 133
are 1698
written 208
on 2214
loose 8
leaves 120
and 8393
at 1573
present 49
arranged 21
in 5712
a 4724
manner 44
which 2527
has 543
no 1050
justification 2
beyond 85
the 22906
fancy 5
of 11214
the 22906
collector 1
who 407
first 391
brought 34
them 615
together 116
to 5281
make 297
volumes 6
of 11214
more 471

as 2230
the 22906
connection 50
of 11214
the 22906

was 582
concerned 7
was 582
obviously 16
a 4724
matter 29
of 11214
indifference 1
to 5281
him 242
the 22906
only 301
point 217
he 657
seems 131
to 5281
have 934
kept 13
in 5712
view 42
when 654
first 391
writing 51
down 153
his 842
notes 148
was 582
that 2876
each 327
observation 10

the 22906
exceptions 2
to 5281
this 1925
rule 37
are 1698
extremely 13
few 69
and 8393
it 3057
is 4252
certainly 49
noteworthy 3
that 2876
we 454
find 151
in 5712
such 295
cases 28
in 5712

this 1925

the 22906
continuation 4
of 11214
the 22906
previous 10
page 94
and 8393
the 22906
like 227
is 4252
not 1185
this 1925
sufficient 13
to 5281
prove 62
that 2876
it 3057
was 582
only 301
in 5712
quite 52
exceptional 9
cases 28
that 2876
the 22906
writer 9
intended 45
the 22906
consecutive 4
pages 20
to 5281
remain 69
connected 26
when 654
he 657
should 299
at 1573
last 89
carry 58
out 265
the 22906
often 60
planned 3
arrangement 53
of 11214
his 842
writings 24
what 194

a 4724
fortuitous 2

there 489

that 2876

the 22906

this 1925

us 133
now 146
it 3057

almost 65
inexplicable 2
that 2876

remained 33
so 641
long 125
unpublished 3

indeed 41
forgotten 3
it 3057
is 4252
certain 89
that 2876

xviith 3
centuries 9
their 737
exceptional 9
value 20
was 582
highly 30
appreciated 4

proved 89
not 1185
merely 41
by 2138
the 22906

which 2527
they 835
commanded 2
but 800
also 202
by 2138
the 22906
exceptional 9
interest 31
which 2527
has 543
been 363
attached 16
to 5281
the 22906

only 301
be 2099
accounted 3
for 1177

the 22906

several 77
short 54
words 66
into 402
one 736

to 5281

therefore 124
not 1185
surprising 4
that 2876

extremely 13

it 3057

certainly 49
noteworthy 3
that 2876

the 22906

not 1185
this 1925
sufficient 13
to 5281
prove 62
that 2876
it 3057
was 582
only 301
in 5712
quite 52
exceptional 9
cases 28
that 2876
the 22906

out 265
the 22906
often 60
planned 3

in 5712
other 589

this 1925
authoritative 1
clue 10
is 4252
wanting 20
but 800
the 22906
difficulties 9
arising 1
from 1666
this 1925
are 1698
not 1185
insuperable 2
for 1177
as 2230
the 22906

always 164
distinct 23
and 8393
well 143
defined 21
in 5712
itself 208
it 3057
is 4252
quite 52
possible 50
to 5281
construct 5
a 4724
wellplanned 1
whole 167
out 265

the 22906
scattered 14

of 11214

i 956
may 610
venture 2
to 5281
state 29
that 2876

thus 213
the 22906

have 934
already 74
shown 106
that 2876
it 3057

due 32
to 5281
nothing 94
but 800
a 4724
fortuitous 2
succession 5
of 11214
unfortunate 1
circumstances 11
that 2876
we 454
should 299
not 1185

have 934
known 78
leonardo 424
not 1185
merely 41
as 2230
a 4724
painter 101
but 800
as 2230
an 538
author 21
a 4724
philosopher 7
and 8393
a 4724
naturalist 3
there 489
can 330
be 2099
no 1050
doubt 50
that 2876
in 5712
more 471
than 652
one 736
department 6
his 842
principles 24
and 8393
discoveries 4
were 373
infinitely 13
more 471
in 5712
accord 4
with 1744
the 22906
teachings 1
of 11214
modern 9
science 27
than 652
with 1744
the 22906
views 21
of 11214
his 842
contemporaries 9
for 1177
this 1925
reason 126
his 842
extraordinary 1
gifts 2
and 8393
merits 3
are 1698
far 121
more 471
likely 17
to 5281
be 2099
appreciated 4
in 5712
our 152
own 152
time 282
than 652
they 835
could 117
have 934
been 363
during 31
the 22906
preceding 26
centuries 9
he 657
has 543
been 363
unjustly 1
accused 2
of 11214
having 132
squandered 1
his 842
powers 7
by 2138
beginning 74
a 4724
variety 29
of 11214
studies 85
and 8393
then 393
having 132
hardly 42
begun 16
throwing 9
them 615
aside 6
the 22906
truth 26
is 4252
that 2876
the 22906
labours 12
of 11214
three 130
centuries 9
have 934
hardly 42
sufficed 3
for 1177
the 22906
elucidation 1
of 11214
some 346
of 11214
the 22906
problems 9

alexander 4

also 202

has 543
no 1050
justification 2
beyond 85
the 22906
fancy 5
of 11214
the 22906

who 407
first 391
brought 34

in 5712

when 654
first 391
writing 51
down 153

extremely 13

it 3057

certainly 49
noteworthy 3

the 22906

not 1185
this 1925
sufficient 13
to 5281
prove 62
that 2876
it 3057
was 582
only 301
in 5712
quite 52
exceptional 9
cases 28
that 2876

out 265
the 22906
often 60
planned 3
arrangement 53
of 11214

this 1925
authoritative 1
clue 10
is 4252
wanting 20
but 800
the 22906
difficulties 9
arising 1
from 1666
this 1925
are 1698
not 1185
insuperable 2
for 1177
as 2230
the 22906

always 164
distinct 23
and 8393
well 143
defined 21
in 5712
itself 208
it 3057
is 4252
quite 52
possible 50
to 5281
construct 5
a 4724
wellplanned 1
whole 167

of 11214

i 956
may 610
venture 2
to 5281
state 29
that 2876

thus 213
the 22906

to 5281
my 170
own 152
estimate 10
of 11214
the 22906
value 20
of 11214
their 737
contents 16
i 956
have 934
already 74
shown 106
that 2876
it 3057
is 4252
due 32
to 5281
nothing 94
but 800
a 4724
fortuitous 2
succession 5
of 11214
unfortunate 1
circumstances 11
that 2876
we 454
should 299
not 1185
long 125
since 135
have 934
known 78
leonardo 424
not 1185
merely 41
as 2230
a 4724
painter 101
but 800
as 2230
an 538
author 21
a 4724
philosopher 7
and 8393
a 4724
naturalist 3
there 489
can 330
be 2099
no 1050
doubt 50
that 2876
in 5712
more 471
than 652
one 736
department 6
his 842
principles 24
and 8393
discoveries 4
were 373
infinitely 13
more 471
in 5712
accord 4
with 1744
the 22906
teachings 1
of 11214
modern 9
science 27
than 652
with 1744
the 22906
views 21
of 11214
his 842
contemporaries 9
for 1177
this 1925
reason 126
his 842
extraordinary 1
gifts 2
and 8393
merits 3
are 1698
far 121
more 471
likely 17
to 5281
be 2099
appreciated 4
in 5712
our 152
own 152

than 652

indeed 41
forgotten 3
it 3057

their 737

proved 89
not 1185
merely 41
by 2138

they 835
commanded 2
but 800
also 202

exceptional 9

attached 16
to 5281

short 54
words 66

the 22906

such 295

sufficient 13
to 5281

to 5281
a 4724

therefore 124
not 1185
surprising 4
that 2876

essentially 3
of 11214
an 538
enquirer 1
hence 96
the 22906
analytical 1
method 41
is 4252
that 2876
which 2527
he 657
employs 3
in 5712
arguing 3
out 265
his 842
investigations 16

the 22906
vast 28
structure 20

consequently 16
built 22
up 308
of 11214
numerous 38
separate 35

and 8393
it 3057
is 4252
much 268
to 5281
be 2099
lamented 2
that 2876

forth 40

for 1177
that 2876
reason 126
i 956
do 257

think 18
that 2876
the 22906

it 3057
added 47
to 5281
this 1925

in 5712
a 4724
manner 44
which 2527
has 543
no 1050
justification 2
beyond 85
the 22906
fancy 5
of 11214
the 22906
collector 1
who 407
first 391
brought 34
them 615
together 116

nothing 94

a 4724
fortuitous 2
succession 5
of 11214

that 2876

as 2230

philosopher 7
and 8393
a 4724

there 489
can 330
be 2099
no 1050
doubt 50
that 2876
in 5712
more 471
than 652
one 736

more 471

modern 9

than 652
with 1744
the 22906

for 1177
this 1925
reason 126
his 842
extraordinary 1

centuries 9
he 657
has 543
been 363
unjustly 1
accused 2
of 11214

squandered 1
his 842
powers 7

begun 16
throwing 9
them 615
aside 6
the 22906
truth 26
is 4252
that 2876
the 22906
labours 12
of 11214
three 130
centuries 9
have 934
hardly 42
sufficed 3

the 22906

this 1925

us 133
now 146
it 3057

almost 65
inexplicable 2

have 934
remained 33
so 641
long 125
unpublished 3

indeed 41
forgotten 3
it 3057
is 4252
certain 89
that 2876

centuries 9
their 737
exceptional 9

was 582

appreciated 4

proved 89
not 1185
merely 41
by 2138
the 22906

which 2527
they 835
commanded 2
but 800
also 202
by 2138
the 22906
exceptional 9
interest 31
which 2527
has 543
been 363
attached 16
to 5281

only 301
be 2099
accounted 3

which 2527
has 543
no 1050
justification 2
beyond 85
the 22906
fancy 5
of 11214
the 22906

who 407
first 391
brought 34

as 2230
the 22906

of 11214

was 582

was 582
obviously 16
a 4724
matter 29
of 11214
indifference 1
to 5281
him 242
the 22906
only 301
point 217
he 657
seems 131
to 5281
have 934
kept 13
in 5712
view 42
when 654
first 391
writing 51
down 153
his 842
notes 148
was 582
that 2876

the 22906
exceptions 2
to 5281
this 1925
rule 37
are 1698
extremely 13
few 69
and 8393
it 3057
is 4252
certainly 49
noteworthy 3
that 2876
we 454
find 151
in 5712
such 295

of 11214
the 22906
previous 10
page 94
and 8393
the 22906
like 227
is 4252
not 1185
this 1925
sufficient 13
to 5281
prove 62
that 2876
it 3057
was 582
only 301
in 5712
quite 52
exceptional 9
cases 28
that 2876
the 22906
writer 9
intended 45
the 22906
consecutive 4
pages 20
to 5281
remain 69
connected 26
when 654
he 657
should 299
at 1573
last 89
carry 58
out 265
the 22906
often 60
planned 3
arrangement 53
of 11214
his 842
writings 24
what 194
this 1925
final 14

was 582
to 5281
be 2099
leonardo 424
has 543
in 5712
most 254
cases 28
indicated 17
with 1744
considerable 18
completeness 3
in 5712
other 589
cases 28
this 1925
authoritative 1
clue 10
is 4252
wanting 20
but 800
the 22906
difficulties 9
arising 1
from 1666
this 1925
are 1698
not 1185
insuperable 2
for 1177
as 2230
the 22906
subject 67
of 11214
the 22906
separate 35
paragraphs 3
is 4252
always 164
distinct 23
and 8393
well 143
defined 21
in 5712
itself 208
it 3057
is 4252
quite 52
possible 50
to 5281
construct 5
a 4724
wellplanned 1
whole 167
out 265
of 11214
the 22906
scattered 14
materials 35
of 11214
his 842
scientific 17
system 9
and 8393
i 956
may 610
venture 2
to 5281
state 29
that 2876
i 956
have 934
devoted 6
especial 1
care 23
and 8393
thought 16
to 5281
the 22906

execution 6
of 11214

them 615
on 2214
without 181
any 372
serious 3
interruption 1
till 64
his 842
death 70
thus 213
the 22906

that 2876

represent 74
a 4724

about 151

so 641

value 20
of 11214

have 934
already 74
shown 106
that 2876
it 3057
is 4252
due 32
to 5281
nothing 94
but 800
a 4724
fortuitous 2
succession 5
of 11214
unfortunate 1
circumstances 11
that 2876
we 454
should 299
not 1185
long 125
since 135
have 934
known 78
leonardo 424
not 1185
merely 41
as 2230
a 4724
painter 101
but 800
as 2230
an 538
author 21
a 4724
philosopher 7
and 8393
a 4724
naturalist 3
there 489
can 330
be 2099
no 1050
doubt 50
that 2876
in 5712
more 471
than 652
one 736
department 6
his 842
principles 24
and 8393
discoveries 4
were 373
infinitely 13
more 471
in 5712
accord 4
with 1744
the 22906
teachings 1
of 11214
modern 9
science 27
than 652
with 1744
the 22906
views 21
of 11214
his 842
contemporaries 9
for 1177
this 1925
reason 126
his 842
extraordinary 1
gifts 2
and 8393
merits 3
are 1698
far 121
more 471
likely 17
to 5281
be 2099
appreciated 4
in 5712
our 152
own 152
time 282
than 652
they 835
could 117
have 934
been 363
during 31
the 22906
preceding 26
centuries 9
he 657
has 543
been 363
unjustly 1
accused 2
of 11214
having 132
squandered 1
his 842
powers 7
by 2138
beginning 74
a 4724
variety 29
of 11214
studies 85
and 8393
then 393
having 132
hardly 42
begun 16
throwing 9
them 615
aside 6
the 22906
truth 26
is 4252
that 2876
the 22906
labours 12
of 11214
three 130
centuries 9
have 934
hardly 42
sufficed 3
for 1177
the 22906
elucidation 1
of 11214
some 346
of 11214
the 22906
problems 9
which 2527
occupied 14
his 842
mighty 2

alexander 4
von 10
