# Digital Communication

Main focus of this course, is to get familiar with error detection techniques. 

Two assignments that achieve this are :
- The main CRC simulation (40% of the final grade)
- a Bonus assignment (7th Lab +20% in the final grade)
<br /><br />

The first one is made with **C Language** and you can find more information in [this readMe](https://github.com/tsingi-chris/CSD-Auth/tree/main/4th%20Semester/Digital%20Communications/CRC#digital-communication-crc-project) .
